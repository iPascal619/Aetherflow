# AetherFlow

AetherFlow is an embedded AI-powered system for early prediction of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in sickle cell disease patients. It uses symptom data and a machine learning model to provide real-time risk assessment, helping patients and caregivers take preventive action.

## üì¶ Description

AetherFlow collects user symptom data (pain, fatigue, fever, hydration, prior crises, etc.), processes it through a trained machine learning model (deployed with TensorFlow Lite Micro), and predicts the likelihood of a crisis within 48 hours. The system is designed for microcontroller platforms and can be integrated into wearable or portable health devices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iPascal619/Aetherflow.git
cd aetherflow
```

### 2. **Python Environment (for data & model)**
```sh
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Generate Data & Train Model**
```sh
python model/simulate_data.py
python model/train_model.py
```
- This will create a balanced dataset and export a TFLite model.

### 4. **Build Embedded Inference (C++)**
- Navigate to the TFLite Micro example directory:
  ```sh
  cd tflite-micro/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/aetherflow
  ```
- Build using your platform‚Äôs toolchain (e.g., `make`, PlatformIO, Arduino IDE, etc.).
- Flash the binary to your microcontroller or run on your desktop for testing.
